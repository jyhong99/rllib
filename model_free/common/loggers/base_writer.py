"""Writer interfaces for logger backends.

provides a failure-isolating wrapper for non-critical writer backends.

class Writer(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for metric writer backends.

    This interface defines a minimal, side-effecting sink for scalar metrics
    produced during training or evaluation loops (e.g., RL, optimization).

    The writer is intentionally *stateless from the caller's perspective*:
    it consumes rows of key–value pairs and manages its own buffering,
    serialization, and persistence strategy.

    Contract
    --------
    - `write(row)` must accept a mapping of metric names to scalar floats.
    - Writers MAY support special meta-keys (e.g., "step", "wall_time"),
      but this is writer-specific and not enforced at the interface level.
    - `flush()` and `close()` should be best-effort and idempotent.

    Notes
    -----
    - Implementations are expected to be *side-effecting* (I/O, IPC, etc.).
    - Implementations SHOULD raise exceptions on failure; suppression is
      handled explicitly by wrappers such as `SafeWriter`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        row : Mapping[str, float]
            Dictionary-like object mapping metric names to scalar values.
            Values are expected to be finite floats; validation is implementation-defined.

        Raises
        ------

class SafeWriter(Writer):
    """
    Exception-swallowing wrapper for a :class:`Writer`.

    This class enforces *failure isolation*: failures in the underlying writer
    MUST NOT propagate to the training loop or caller. All exceptions raised
    by the wrapped writer are silently suppressed.

    Typical use cases include:
    - Best-effort logging (CSV, TensorBoard, remote logging)
    - Non-critical diagnostics
    - Long-running training where logging failures must not interrupt progress

    Parameters
    ----------
    inner : Writer
        The concrete writer instance to wrap.
    name : str, optional
        Human-readable identifier for diagnostics or debugging.
        Defaults to ``inner.__class__.__name__``.

    Notes
    -----
    - This wrapper intentionally discards all exceptions.
    - If diagnostics are required, extend this class to record failure counts
      or last-seen exceptions.
    - This class does NOT attempt retries or recovery.

        Initialize a guarded writer wrapper.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inner : Writer
            Concrete writer implementation to wrap. Calls to :meth:`write`,
            :meth:`flush`, and :meth:`close` are forwarded to this object.
        name : str, optional
            Optional diagnostic label for the wrapped writer. When omitted,
            the class name of ``inner`` is used.

        Notes
        -----
        This initializer does not validate the full runtime interface beyond
        the type annotation; any errors are handled lazily when methods are
        invoked and exceptions are swallowed by design.
