class JSONLWriter(Writer):
    """
    JSON Lines (JSONL) writer for scalar metric logging.

    This writer appends **exactly one JSON object per `write()` call**,
    serialized onto a single line (newline-delimited JSON):

    ``{"key": value, ...}\\n``

    The JSONL format is convenient because it is:
    - Append-friendly (streaming / tailing / resume-safe)
    - Easy to parse with common tooling (e.g., pandas, jq)
    - Robust to schema changes over time (new keys can appear at any step)

    Parameters
    ----------
    run_dir : str
        Directory where the JSONL file will be created/appended.
    filename : str, default="metrics.jsonl"
        JSONL filename inside ``run_dir``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _path : str
        Absolute path to the JSONL file.
    _f : TextIO
        Open file handle in append mode.

    Notes
    -----
    - The file is opened in append-text mode.
    - Parent directory is expected to exist. If you want auto-create behavior,
      ensure `run_dir` exists before constructing this writer.
    - Serialization is delegated to ``_json_dumps`` to centralize policies such as:
      float formatting, NumPy scalar handling, and NaN/Inf handling (if supported).
    """

    def __init__(self, run_dir: str, filename: str = "metrics.jsonl") -> None:

        Initialize a JSONL file writer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        run_dir : str
            Directory where the JSONL file will be created or appended.
        filename : str, default="metrics.jsonl"
            Output filename inside ``run_dir``.

        Notes
        -----
        The target file is opened immediately in append mode and kept open for
        the writer lifetime for lower per-write overhead.

        Append one metric row as a single JSON object line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        row : Dict[str, float]
            Mapping from metric names to scalar float values. Common examples:
            ``{"step": 1000, "loss": 0.23, "reward_mean": 1.5}``.

        Notes
        -----
        - The input is defensively copied via ``dict(row)`` to decouple from
          caller-side mutations.
        - Exactly one newline is appended per call, producing strict JSONL.
        - This method performs no explicit flushing; call `flush()` if you need
          stronger durability guarantees.

        Notes
        -----
        - Exceptions are swallowed by ``_safe_call``.
        - Flushing does not guarantee durability on all systems unless the OS
