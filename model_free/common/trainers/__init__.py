Trainers
====================

This package provides a unified, high-level training interface for
reinforcement learning algorithms, supporting:

- Single-environment training loops
- Ray-based multi-worker rollout and learning
- Evaluation, checkpointing, and callback-driven extensibility

The design goal is to keep the public API minimal and stable, while
isolating optional dependencies (e.g., Ray) behind guarded imports.

Public API
----------
Trainer
    Unified training orchestrator that coordinates environments, algorithms,
    logging, evaluation, callbacks, checkpointing, and (optionally) Ray workers.

build_trainer
    High-level factory that constructs environments, logger, evaluator,
    callbacks, and returns a fully-configured Trainer instance.

Evaluator
    Episode-based policy evaluator that runs rollouts and aggregates metrics.

save_checkpoint
    Persist trainer state (counters, env state, algorithm artifact).

load_checkpoint
    Restore trainer state from a saved checkpoint.

run_evaluation
    Execute evaluation via the trainer's attached Evaluator and emit side effects.

Optional Ray API
----------------
RayEnvRunner
    Worker-side environment runner used by Ray actors.

RayLearner
    Learner-side orchestrator that manages RayEnvRunner actors.

_RAY_AVAILABLE
    Boolean flag indicating whether Ray-dependent symbols are available.

Notes
-----
- Ray is an optional dependency. This module remains importable even when
  Ray is not installed.
- Ray-related classes are exposed only if the import succeeds.
- This file intentionally contains *no heavy logic*; it only defines
  the public surface of the training subsystem.
